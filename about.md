Hi! I'm **Valeria Garcia**, a first-generation Latina in STEM, software engineering student, and research facilitator passionate about using tech to drive equity in health and education.

🌟 I'm currently a Research Facilitator at the Texas Christian University Institute of Behavioral Research, where I help conduct studies focused on HIV prevention and opioid use disorder among justice-involved individuals. I assist with participant coordination, REDCap data entry, testing (HIV, HCV, STI's), and maintaining our Mobile Health Unit — all while mentoring new team members.

🧠 I’m pursuing a Bachelor's in Software Engineering while expanding my skills in DevOps, data automation, and circuit design. I’ve built research dashboards, streamlined data pipelines using Excel/Qualtrics/REDCap, and even developed Finite State Machine (FSM) controllers using Logisim. I also love working with Arduino, sensors, and microcontrollers to bring ideas to life.

### 📚 Fun Facts About Me

- I’m a **total bookworm** — nothing beats getting lost in a good novel. I’ll talk about my favorite reads for hours.
- I love coding with a latte in hand and a cozy playlist in the background ☕🎧
- Big **K-drama watcher** and proud collector of cute stationery and gadgets (let me know if you want to trade smiskis haha)✨
- I’ve worked full-time since I was 16 — from waitress to lead pharmacy tech to researcher
- My dogs are my heart 🐶 and I take way too many photos of them (impossible, I know)

### 🎯 My Why
I believe that combining technology, compassion, and lived experience can create systems that work for *everyone* — especially historically marginalized communities. Whether I’m working on a robotics project or translating health forms into Spanish, my goal is always the same: build something meaningful.
