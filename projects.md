### 🌊 Automated Ocean Cleanup Bot

As part of a collaborative robotics project, I helped design an autonomous robot to assist with ocean surface debris removal. My role focused on:
- Logic design using Arduino (C++) and ultrasonic sensors
- Coordinating communication between multiple robots to cover more area
- Testing system behavior and optimizing cleanup paths
This project taught me a lot about automation, teamwork, and environmental technology.

### 🔬 ACTION Study: Research Tech in Motion

In my current research role, I’ve helped automate fieldwork and data processes using:
- **Qualtrics + Excel** systems to track daily mileage and visits
- **REDCap** for participant health data and testing records
- Translating and updating research tools for Spanish-speaking participants

This helped streamline health screening for HIV, HCV, A1C, and more in justice-involved populations.

### 🧠 FSM Calculator (Java + Logisim)

For a software engineering assignment, I developed a calculator powered by a finite state machine:
- Created Boolean equations from truth tables
- Used Logisim to simulate logic gates and register states
- Validated input/output operations through step-by-step testing

It was my first time applying logic design outside of theory — and I loved it.

### 💡 Always Learning

I'm continuing to grow through certifications in:
- IBM DevOps & Software Engineering (in progress)
- Microsoft Career Essentials in Data Analysis (completed)

More to come — I'm just getting started. 🚀
