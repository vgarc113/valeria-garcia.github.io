👋 ¡Hola! I’m **Valeria Garcia**, a first-generation Latina in STEM who blends research, code, and community advocacy. Currently pursuing a Bachelor's in Software Engineering, I also work as a research facilitator focused on health equity and justice-involved populations.  

💡 I love building things that matter — from mobile health unit data systems to automated robotics projects (with a sprinkle of pastel UI design).

🎓 Poster presenter @ ACCJH 2025

🐱 Probably coding with a cats and/or dogs on my lap
